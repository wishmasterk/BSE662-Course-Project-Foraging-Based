+. For eeg group:
    1. Use mne (preferably v1.8 on python<3.11) to load the set files into Raw format, with proper units, timings, channel locations and event markers (all available in the set file).
    2. Data cleaning: 
        2.1. Plot the power spectral density (PSD) curve of the raw data, find the line noise peak frequency.
        2.2. Apply line noise cleaning functions to obtain clean data.
        2.3. Bandpass between (0.5,90) Hz and plot the PSD of the clean data.
    3. Marker extraction:
        3.1. Each set file contains data for [pre,post] stress x [short,long] envs.
            x.  Marker format: TRIGGER EVENT <>
                B: Start of prestress foraging block
                I: Start of poststress foraging block
                M: Fixation shape appears
                N: Fixation shape turns green
                R: Select leave option
                U: Travel time ~20s
                T: Travel time ~5s
        3.2. Extract the event markers using mne annotations, and use them to figure out how many trials are there in each environment.

+. For bhv group:
    1. Use the bhv_read.m matlab function to read the bhv files into a matlab structure.
    2. Each (pre/post) stress bhv file has data for short and long travel time environments:
        x. ReactionTimes has a NaN in the middle, seperating the environments. But it also has trailing NaNs at the end for bad trials.
        x. UserVars.rwrd has reward data only for good trials, but no seperation between environments. 
        x. AbsoluteTrialStartTimes has the starting timestamp of each trial, but contains no seperation between environments. 
        x. Use AbsoluteTrialStartTmes, ReactionTimes and UserVars.rwrd to figure out how many trials are there in in each environment.
    3. Put the seperated trial data in a matlab table, something like: [subid, stress_cond, env, trial_time, reaction_time, reward], and save it as a csv.

+. For both groups: Do the number of trials (extracted from the EEG and behavioral data) in each stress x environment match?
